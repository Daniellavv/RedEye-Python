# RedEye-Python
Python project regarding the effectiveness of the RedEye Service, an on-campus service of Northeastern University. An analysis of the effectiveness of the service along with room for improvemnet have been captured and noted. In addition, we will also look into how accessible the RedEye is, the safety of students on campus, and learn more about any other alternative commuting options available. Ultimately the analysis is something that will be important to the students and pertinent to the stakeholder of Northeastern especially if the school is looking into making changes to transportation on campus.

# Data sources :
1. Student Survey :
- First hand collection of data (~80% graduate and 20% undergraduate)
- Understand more about the RedEye service itself
- Understanding pattern of students leaving campus during RedEye service hours.
2. Analyze Boston's Crime incident Report:
- Secondary source to supplement our current data set
- Public source
- Crimes from the start of 2022 - now, used to check safety of students during their commute to campus.
3. MBTA:
- Chosen as a comparison for alternate commute to RedEye service.
- Understand reliance and communication of MBTA services.
- Public source

# Methods and Tools:
- Cleaned and wrangled the datasets (crime data,student survey,MBTA ) using excel and Python.
- Libraries used : Numpy, Pandas, GeoPandas, geopy.distance, sklearn.neighbors, uszipcode.
